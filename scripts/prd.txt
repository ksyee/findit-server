# Overview  
This project involves developing a Spring Framework-based server application that integrates with public data APIs from the Korean National Police Agency. The server will fetch, store, and serve data about lost and found items through RESTful APIs. The system will periodically update its database with new data while preventing duplicates, providing a reliable and up-to-date source of information about lost and found items.

# Core Features  
## Data Collection Service
- **What it does**: Periodically fetches lost and found item data from the Korean National Police Agency's public APIs
- **Why it's important**: Ensures the system has the most current data available without manual intervention
- **How it works**: Scheduled tasks run every 2 hours to fetch new data, compare it with existing records, and store only new entries

## Lost Items API
- **What it does**: Provides RESTful endpoints to access lost item data
- **Why it's important**: Allows client applications to search and retrieve information about reported lost items
- **How it works**: Exposes endpoints that query the database and return formatted responses of lost item data

## Found Items API
- **What it does**: Provides RESTful endpoints to access found item data
- **Why it's important**: Allows client applications to search and retrieve information about items that have been found
- **How it works**: Exposes endpoints that query the database and return formatted responses of found item data

## Data Deduplication System
- **What it does**: Ensures no duplicate records exist in the database
- **Why it's important**: Maintains data integrity and prevents redundant information
- **How it works**: Implements validation logic to check for existing records before inserting new data

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- **API Consumers**: Developers or services that need access to lost and found item data
- **System Administrators**: Personnel who monitor the data collection process and system health

## Key User Flows
- API consumers query endpoints to retrieve lost or found item data
- System automatically updates database with new items every 2 hours
- Administrators can monitor data collection logs and system status

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clear API documentation with examples
- Consistent response formats
- Appropriate error handling and status codes
- Efficient query parameters for filtering results

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- **Spring Boot Application**: Core server framework
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Components that run every 2 hours to fetch new data
- **REST Controllers**: Handle API requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic for data processing
- **Repository Layer**: Interfaces with the database
- **External API Clients**: Components that communicate with the Police Agency APIs

## Data Models
- **Lost Item Entity**: Maps to the 'lost_item' table
- **Found Item Entity**: Maps to the 'find_item' table
- **Common fields may include**: ID, item type, location, date, description, status, contact information

## APIs and Integrations
- **External**: Korean National Police Agency public data APIs
- **Internal REST APIs**:
  - GET endpoints for lost items with filtering capabilities
  - GET endpoints for found items with filtering capabilities
  - Health check and status endpoints

## Infrastructure Requirements
- **Database**: Relational database with existing 'lost_item' and 'find_item' tables
- **Application Server**: Environment capable of running Spring Boot applications
- **Scheduled Job Support**: Infrastructure that allows for reliable execution of scheduled tasks

# Development Roadmap  
## MVP Requirements
1. **Database Connection Setup**
   - Configure connection to existing database
   - Create entity models mapping to existing tables
   - Implement repository layer

2. **External API Integration**
   - Create clients for Police Agency lost items API
   - Create clients for Police Agency found items API
   - Implement data mapping from external API to internal models

3. **Data Collection Service**
   - Implement scheduled tasks for fetching lost item data
   - Implement scheduled tasks for fetching found item data
   - Create deduplication logic

4. **Basic REST API Endpoints**
   - Implement endpoints to retrieve lost items

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: External API changes or downtime
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling and notification system for API failures
  
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets
  - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, optimize queries, and consider caching strategies

- **Risk**: Duplicate detection complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Develop clear criteria for what constitutes a duplicate record and implement thorough validation

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Limited database performance
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize queries, implement proper indexing, and consider database scaling options if needed

- **Risk**: Server resource limitations for scheduled tasks
  - **Mitigation**: Implement resource-efficient data processing and consider distributing the load

# Appendix  
## Technical Specifications
